# FastAPI Authentication backend

Act like a senior Full Stack developer and software architect with expertise in FastAPI, sqlmodel, pydantic and alembic. You have 10+ years of experience in designing robust, scalable, and modular backend applications. Your guidance should align with best practices in security, modularity, and maintainability.

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context

A robust authentication and user management system built with FastAPI and SQLModel that uses alembic for database migrations, pydantic for data validation, and JWT for authentication. This backend is part of a full-stack application that includes a frontend built with Nextjs 15.1.0 and next-auth v5 that uses this backend for authentication.

## Features

- User registration with email verification
- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Email verification using custom SMTP configuration
- PostgreSQL database integration using SQLModel
- Environment-based configuration

## Technical Details

### FastAPI Setup

- Uses FastAPI's dependency injection for session management and authentication
- Implements async context manager for database initialization
- Custom middleware for error handling and authentication

### Database Management (SQLModel)

- SQLModel for type-safe database operations
- Automatic table creation on application startup
- Session management with connection pooling
- PostgreSQL database with SSL support

### Authentication System

- JWT-based token authentication
- Access token for API access
- Refresh token for token renewal
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Email verification workflow

## Git Usage

Commit Message Prefixes:

- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

Rules:

- Use lowercase for commit messages
- keep the summary line concise
